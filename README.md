# Running the Game
You can try the newest version of Resonance at any time by downloading the zip from the project page <http://github.com/teamnocontest/reaper/>. Click "Download ZIP". Save the zip file to any directory you prefer. When the download is done, extract the archive into its own directory. Navigate into the project folder, and from there into the Unity Project directory and run the DemoBuild.exe. This will take you to the launcher where you can configure controls and display settings. Press the Play! Button to run the game.
**NOTE:** There is currently no exit button in the game. To quit the game, you must either use Alt+F4 to force the process to terminate, or press Alt + Tab to escape the window then right click on the game's icon in the taskbar and chose 'close' to end the process.

#Building the Game
If you have Unity 4.3.4 installed, you can open the Unity Project folder with Unity to play around with the included assets or make your own tweaks. The existing playable is the DefaultTestingScene in the Scenes directory.
